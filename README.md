##Facial Emotion Recognition Using Convolutional Neural Networks##
This project builds a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify facial expressions into seven categories: angry, disgust, fear, happy, neutral, sad, and surprise. The model is trained on a custom facial emotion dataset and evaluated using k-fold cross-validation.
